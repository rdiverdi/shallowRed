<p>We are making a chess AI, beginning with minmax searching and alpha-beta pruning, then incorporating neural networks and evolutionary algorithms to optimize the performance.</p>

  Background and Context
</h4>

<p>
  Chess AIs generally start with a min-max search algorithm which looks ahead a certain number of moves and 
  evaluates that move based on the maximum possible loss due to that move.  The algorithm then chooses the move
  with the smallest maximum loss.  Loss is measured by giving a value to each piece, which is then gained or lost
  when that piece is captured or lost. <br>
  Alpha-beta pruning is a meathod for speeding up the min-max algorithm by ignoring branches of the seach tree 
  which are obviously worse than already checked branches. <br>

 Key Questions
</h4>

<p>
  Is it better to make our own basic AI and work from there, or start with someome else's and focus on extensions? <br>
  What is an interesting "new" direction to take chess AIs (for example, evolutionary algorithms for peice weights, 
  neural networks for more informative board evaluations, other cool ideas)?

  Agenda
</h4>

<p>
  Introduce problem: <br>
  &nbsp; -Talk about how computers play chess <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -computers are effient but play in a boring and computationally intensive manner <br>
  &nbsp; -We want to use a new approach to play chess in a more interesting manner <br><br>
  
  Ideation for ways to computationally play chass: <br>
  &nbsp; -Get some ideas for potential approaches before we give any background on existing algorithms <br><br>
  
  Discuss existing algorithms: <br>
  &nbsp; -Explain min-max searches and alpha-beta pruning <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -pieces are weighted and lost/captured pieces are used to value moves <br><br>
  
  Explain ideas for improvements: <br>
  &nbsp; -Evolutionary algorithms <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -improve weighting for pieces in min-max searching by optimizing the weights with evolutionary algorithms <br>
  &nbsp; -Neural networks <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Use a database of past chess games to decide on a move based on analysis of board positions.
